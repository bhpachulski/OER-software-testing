\begin{block:concept}{Fault-based testing}
Fault-based testing is a technique in which testing is based on historical
information about common faults detected during the software development life
cycle.
\end{block:concept}


\begin{block:fact}{Rationale}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fault-based testing technique uses information about:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item faults which are frequently found in software developments, and
		\item specific types of faults that one may want to uncover.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
