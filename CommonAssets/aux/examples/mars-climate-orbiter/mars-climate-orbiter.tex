\frametitle{Mars Climate Orbiter}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Mars Climate Orbiter was a NASA spacecraft that would study the
	Martian weather, climate, water and carbon dioxide budget.

	\item It was intended to enter orbit at an altitude of 140.5 - 150 km
	above Mars.

	\item However, a navigation error caused the spacecraft to reach as low as
	57 km.

	\item The spacecraft was destroyed by atmospheric stresses and friction at
	this low altitude.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The navigation error arose because of a software programming error.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The thruster control software did not properly interpret the data
		fed to it.
	\end{itemize}

	\item The modules of the thruster control were created by separate software
	groups.

	\item One module computed thruster data in English units and forwarded the
	data to a module that expected data in the International System units
	(meters).

	\item This is a very typical integration fault (but in this case enormously
	expensive, both in terms of money and prestige).
