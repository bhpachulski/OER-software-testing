\begin{enumerate}
	\item Consider a program $P$, which belongs to a critical system.

	\item The correct operation of the system depends upon the correctness of
	the program $P$.

	\item Thus, the software tester will test $P$ as much as possible, using
	several test criteria and evaluating the adequacy of the developed test
	cases.

	\item Initially, a test set $C_{1}-adequate$ is created. Now, a question
	is arisen: \textbf{Given a test set $C_{1}-adequate$ and a test criterion
	$C_{2}$, is is possible to improve the current test set?}

	\item Such issue is recurrent when deciding whether a program has been
	sufficiently tested.

	\item Experimental studies can evaluate test criteria properties, providing
	evidences that aids the software tester decision making regarding such
	issues.
