\frametitle{Incorrect statement}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Consider the following statement, as defined in the software
	requirements specification.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The $z$ dimension value of the vortex is the sum of its $x$ and
		$y$ dimension values.
	\end{itemize}

	\item By an unknown reason (the cat walked on the keyboard, insomnia,
	keyboard malfunctioning), the programmer wrote a statement that does
	not correctly implements the requirement:
	\begin{lstlisting}
		z = x - y.
	\end{lstlisting}

	\item This programmer incurred into a mistake, which characterized a fault.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Incorrect statement}

\begin{itemize}
	\item If such a fault is activated (executed) with \srccode{x = 0},
	regardless of the value of \srccode{y}, no incorrect output is produced.
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Although the fault is activated, it does not lead to
	    an error and no failure occurs.
	\end{itemize}

	\item For any other value different from \srccode{x = 0}, the fault
	activation causes an error on the variable \srccode{z}.
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Such an error, when propagated until the product output, will
	    result in a failure.
    \end{itemize}
