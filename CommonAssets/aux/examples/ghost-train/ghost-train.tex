\frametitle{Ghost Train}
\framesubtitle{Description}

\begin{itemize}
	\item In 1995, failures were registered by the sensors in the rails
	situated in tunnels within England channels.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The trains stopped due to suspicion that another train was in the
		rail.
	\end{itemize}

	\item The cause was that the salty water fog was confusing the sensors.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The system requirements probably didn't considered the salty
		water fog as a possible event.

		\item Adequate system testing and validation could have detected the
		problem.
