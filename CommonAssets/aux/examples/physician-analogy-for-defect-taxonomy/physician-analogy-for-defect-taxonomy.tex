\frametitle{Physician analogy for defect taxonomy}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Consider a physician making a diagnosis for a patient.

	\item The patient enters the physician's office with a list of
	\textbf{failures} (that is, symptoms).

	\item The physician then must discover the \textbf{fault}, or root cause of
	the symptom.

	\item To aid in the diagnosis, the physician may order tests that look for
	anomalous internal conditions, such as high blood pressure, an irregular
	heartbeat, high levels of blood glucose, or high cholesterol.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In our terminology, these anomalous internal conditions
		correspond to \textbf{errors}.
	\end{itemize}
