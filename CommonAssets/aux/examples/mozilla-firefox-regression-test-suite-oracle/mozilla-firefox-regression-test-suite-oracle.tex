\begin{itemize}
	\item Mozilla runs build computers that continually build the latest source
	code.

	\item A tool, called Thinderbox, collects the test results and compare to
	the previous version of the product under testing.

	\item It uses tables to describe status of the source tree for the
	platform, product, and code branch:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 1
		\item The green bar means the latest code compiles and passes the tests
		that are run on the box.
		\item Red means the build failed during compilation.
		\item Orange means the binary was built successfully, but failed some
		of the tests.
		\item Yellow means the build and testing are in progress.
	\end{itemize}

	\item Tinderbox for Firefox:
