\label{example:challenger-mishap}

\begin{itemize}
	\item In 1986, 73 seconds after taking off, a explosion destroyed the space
	shuttle Challenger, killing 7 astronauts.

	\item Investigations arrived at the conclusion that some rocket joints were
	not projected for the temperature and pressure they were suffering.

	\item Failure cause:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The pressure specification was not correct for the system
		requirement.

		\item The tests were insufficient to detect the failure.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
