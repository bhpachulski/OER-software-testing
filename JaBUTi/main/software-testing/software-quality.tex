\frametitle{Software quality}
\label{concept:software-quality}

\begin{block:concept}{Definition}
Software quality is the conformance to explicitly stated functional and
performance requirements, explicitly documented development standards, and
implicit characteristics that are expected of all professionally developed
software~\cite{pressman:2005}
\end{block:concept}


\begin{block:fact}{Why we should care about it?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rising demand for higher software quality.

    \item Software defect reduction improves software quality.
\end{itemize}
\end{block:fact}

\begin{block:fact}{Software quality and software testing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The main goal of software testing is to find defects.

	\item Systematic software testing, carried out using proper techniques,
	criteria, and tools, improves software reliability (and quality).
\end{itemize}
