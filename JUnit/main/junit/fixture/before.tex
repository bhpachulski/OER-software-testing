\begin{block:concept}{Before fixture}
Before is a fixture that is used to set up pre-conditions for a test
case.
\end{block:concept}

\begin{block:fact}{How to use it?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Before fixture is created by annotating a method with
	\srccode{@Before}.

	\item Before fixtures run before a JUnit test case.

	\item Before fixtures declared in the superclasses will be run before those
	of the current class.

	\item No ordering is defined when running Before fixtures declared in the
	same class.
\end{itemize}
