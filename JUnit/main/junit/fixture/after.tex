by a test case.
\end{block:concept}

\begin{block:fact}{How to use it?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The After fixture is created by annotating a method with
	\srccode{@After}.

	\item After fixtures run after a JUnit test case.

	\item After fixtures declared in the superclasses will be run before those
	of the current class.

	\item No ordering is defined when running After fixtures declared in the
	same class.
